4 bones in shader: a vertex can only be affected by 4 bones.
"The aiScene contains an array of aiMesh objects."
". A single aiAnimation object represents a sequence of animation frames such as "walk", "run", "shoot", etc."
aiAnimation can be found in AnimationController.h :: ReadNodeHierarchy
AnimationController is using its own dt. ? Does that make it independent from actual engine time?

AnimationController.h::BoneTransform is a hard to read mess
